I will be leading a group of students to generate a mobile app for a local amateur bike race. I will list the general requirements soon, but I also need help delegating work to the different groups as well as how to determine when someone might benefit switching groups. From a students standpoint, I don't feel its fair to work on a mobile app, and get stuck on all SQL query's (unless they choose to do so).

I will have from 5 - 8 students working on all the different components (of which I don't know yet) to get the app to some release mode a year from this week.

If I am compiling latex using `latex workshops` workflow, I understand that I need to do some configuring within vscode to fine tune latex workshop so it processes files more to my liking. But I'm not at a point to where I feel confident enough to do so.
