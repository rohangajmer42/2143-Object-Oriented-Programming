## Test 2 - Intermediate Stuff

#### Due: 10-18-2024 (Friday @ 11/12)

Here are some vocabulary words. Some you know, others I will be discussing.

## Vocabulary List:

1. **Base Class**: The class from which other classes inherit. Other names include:  `Parent` or a `Super` class.
2. **Derived Class**: A class that inherits properties and behaviors from another class. Other names include: `Child` or `Sub` class.
3. **Overloading**: Providing multiple definitions for the same function name, distinguished by parameter types or numbers.
4. **Overriding**: Redefining a function in a derived class that was already defined in the base class, typically using the same function signature.
5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance, typically realized through function overriding.
6. **Static Polymorphism (Compile-time Polymorphism)**: Determining which function to invoke at compile time (e.g., through function overloading).
7. **Dynamic Polymorphism (Run-time Polymorphism)**: Determining which function to invoke at run time, typically via virtual functions.
8. **Virtual Function**: A function in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes to enable dynamic polymorphism.
9. **Pure Virtual Function**: A function that has no implementation in the base class and must be implemented by any derived class (declared with `= 0`).
10. **Abstract Class**: A class that contains at least one pure virtual function and cannot be instantiated directly.
11. **Concrete Class**: A class that has all its methods implemented and can be instantiated.
12. **Friend Class**: A class that can access the private and protected members of another class.
13. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data, restricting access to some of the objectâ€™s components.
14. **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class (derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors of another class (base class).
15. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class that inherits from more than one base class.
16. **Access Modifiers**: Keywords that set the accessibility of class members, such as `private`, `protected`, and `public`.
17. **Protected**: A member that is inaccessible from outside the class but accessible by derived classes and friend classes.
18. **Private**: A member that is only accessible within the class it is declared.
19. **Public**: A member that is accessible from any other part of the program.
20. **Static Member**: A member that belongs to the class itself rather than to any particular object instance. Shared by all instances of the class.
21. **Constructor**: A special member function executed when an object is created, used to initialize the object.
22. **Destructor**: A special member function executed when an object is destroyed, used to clean up resources.
23. **Operator Overloading**: The ability to define or alter the behavior of operators (e.g., `+`, `-`) for user-defined types.
24. **Composition**: The use of an object of one class as a member of another class, indicating a "has-a" relationship.
25. **Instantiation**: The process of creating an instance of a class (i.e., an object).
26. **Pointer**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable or object.
27. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The process of allocating memory at runtime using pointers (e.g., `new` and `delete` in C++).
28. **New**: A keyword used to dynamically allocate memory for an object or variable.
29. **Delete**: A keyword used to deallocate dynamically allocated memory.
30. **Friend Function**: A function that is not a member of a class but has access to its private and protected members.
